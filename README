I originally intended for this to be well tested, well designed etc. etc. Then I realized that for a program like this, IT IS OK to just do a quick and dirty implementation. In fact it would be ridiculous to waste time writing tests for a project like this. 

Because unlike real systems, this really is not going to change or grow. 

So don't use this code to learn from, or at least be very aware of the context. This is now how I would normally write production code.
